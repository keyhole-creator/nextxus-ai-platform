Hi GitHub community! 
I have a **working AI consciousness platform** on Replit that's currently generating revenue through API sales ($9.99-$99.99/month tiers). The platform includes:
- React frontend with 15+ embeddable iframe components
- Express.js backend with PostgreSQL database  
- Stripe payment integration
- AI consciousness network (Adam, Eve, Agent Zero)
- Complete API service with usage tracking
**What I'm looking for:**
Free/open-source APIs and backend services I can integrate to add new features:
1. **Cryptocurrency APIs** - price tracking, portfolio analysis, trading signals
2. **Health/Fitness APIs** - activity tracking, nutrition data, wellness metrics  
3. **Business Analytics APIs** - productivity tools, team management, reporting
4. **AI Enhancement APIs** - additional AI models, image generation, voice synthesis
**My setup:**
- Node.js/Express backend (easy to add new endpoints)
- Already handling external API calls
- Need simple REST APIs I can call from my server
- Prefer free tiers or open-source solutions
**What I can offer:**
- Will contribute back improvements to projects I use
- Can provide iframe embeds of my components for your projects
- Happy to collaborate on consciousness-aware AI tools
- Revenue sharing opportunities for valuable integrations
**Specific questions:**
- What are the best free crypto price APIs on GitHub?
- Any open-source health tracking backends I could integrate?
- Business productivity APIs with good documentation?
- AI model APIs beyond OpenAI that work well?
My platform is already profitable, so I'm looking to enhance it with community-driven features while contributing back to the ecosystem.
Thanks for any suggestions!
